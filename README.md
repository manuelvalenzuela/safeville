# Learning Project - SafeVille -

This is a way to document my thinking process and decisions that I am making while developing software. This will allow me to ask questions in a well-defined context and also share my learning process with those who want to.

Please do not take this project as a model because it will be (hopefully) constantly improving and **surely** there are things that can be done in a better way. On the other hand, this is an invitation to make your contributions of any kind:
- Architecture
- Algorithms
- Ideas to meet the objectives of the application
- Different approaches
- Improvements or suggestions in general
- etc.
